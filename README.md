# Dkord by DeepuGupta

Free, open-source Android music client. YouTube / YouTube Music search, stream resolution and playback run on the phone; no custom paid backend is included. Optional Listen Together rooms use a public relay. Licensed GPL-3.0.

## Features
Broad YouTube search with optional music filters · Home with moods, charts and collapsed-by-default New Releases · background audio with notification, lock-screen and Bluetooth controls · music-only related-radio autoplay · queue, shuffle, repeat, speed and sleep timer · synced lyrics (LRCLIB) · tagged M4A downloads with pause/resume · local playlists with JSON import/export · song sharing · Listen Together rooms · compact in-app updates · dark / light / AMOLED / Material You themes.

## Install and updates
Download the APK from [the latest stable release](https://github.com/DeepuExplainsAi/dkord/releases/latest). Official updates use the same package/signing identity: install over the existing app, **without uninstalling**, to retain playlists, likes, downloads and settings. Uninstalling generally removes local app data.

Home shows a small **Update / Later** notice, not a blocking dialog. Later defers that version for 24 hours; a different newer version can still appear. Foreground checks are throttled to 30 minutes. Settings also provides a manual check and live downloaded / total / remaining MB. APKs are downloaded only after consent, and `/releases/latest` is resolved again before the download, so skipped releases do not require intermediate installations. An old ready APK does not block newer-release checks.

The download is bounded and checked for size and optional release SHA-256. Before installation, the app verifies the APK's package, advertised version, increasing versionCode and installed signing certificates. Android's system installer/unknown-source permission UI completes installation. Downloads share app-lifetime state across screens/rotation; this is **not** a promise of update-download continuation after process death.

## Search and saved queries
New searches default to **All YouTube**, using the normal YouTube search catalogue rather than only the YouTube Music Songs catalogue. Choose **Videos** for normal video results or explicit **Songs / Music videos / Albums / Artists / Playlists** for the corresponding YouTube Music scope. Clearing the field resets the next new search to All YouTube; repeating/editing a saved shortcut still restores its original filter.

Queries are not rewritten with music keywords, and manual search results have no title/genre/duration whitelist: instrumentals, independent creators' covers, karaoke, piano/no-vocals, remixes, slowed/reverb versions, long mixes and short reel-style uploads can appear in provider order. These are examples, not a fixed category list. Searching for an “Instagram version” searches versions uploaded/indexed on YouTube, not Instagram's separate catalogue. Misspellings such as “instumental” go to the provider as typed; available YouTube suggestions/corrections can help without a client-side spelling dictionary silently changing your intent. Different uploads with the same title—even by the same creator—remain separate by video ID, including across pages. Search rows allow two title lines and show the creator plus a known duration; unknown durations are not labeled as zero/live. Existing automatic music-radio recommendation rules remain separate. Video IDs support watch, short, Shorts, live and embed links, including watch links with playlist context. This does not guarantee that every returned upload is playable in guest mode.

The Search screen shows **Recent searches** below the filter chips when the field is empty. Only submitted searches are saved, including submitted attempts that fail offline; typing and loading more results do not add history. Searches made before this feature cannot be recovered.

- Tap an entry to repeat its original query **and filter**. The pencil prefills it for editing without submitting.
- Use its three-dot menu (or long-press) to **Pin / Unpin** or **Remove**. Up to **50** searches are kept, including at most **10** pins. Pins stay above other recents and survive ordinary history eviction.
- **Clear all** asks for confirmation and removes both recent and pinned searches. Clearing the search input only returns to recents; it does not erase history.
- Matching saved queries appear immediately while typing, even offline, in their own section. Real debounced YouTube suggestions keep the provider's order in a separate section, with loading and Retry states instead of silently disappearing on failure. Up to 20 nonblank unique provider suggestions are retained.
- Provider **Did you mean / Showing results for** metadata is displayed when available; it does not silently alter your input or save a correction as a new search. Tap it to submit the corrected query explicitly. A compact catalogue hint and **Search all YouTube** action stay visible for every narrow filter, even when it already returned some results or an old Songs shortcut was repeated. While typing, changing scope only refreshes suggestions; after submission it searches the same query in the chosen scope. Results keep full-list playback; pagination failures keep existing results and offer Retry. Load more is also available for pages that add no visible rows.

Anonymous results and suggestions are not a promise of the exact account-personalized order in the official YouTube / YouTube Music apps. Regional, age/account, availability and playable-format restrictions are not bypassed.

Saved queries use a separate private on-device DataStore, persist across app restarts after the write completes, and are not included in room messages or query logs. Normal queries/suggestions still go to the existing YouTube search service; saving history adds no backend or analytics. The implementation has English and Hindi text. Validation and APK availability for this feature are recorded in `HANDOFF.md`; an existing release does not acquire these changes automatically.

## Languages
The app interface defaults to **English even when the phone uses another language**. Choose **Settings → Appearance → App language → English / Hindi** to change it explicitly. Android 13+ per-app language choices are also honored; resetting the app-language override returns to the app's English default. Original song/artist metadata is not translated, and selecting an interface language retains the device region used for music discovery. Android-owned permission, installer and file-picker screens are controlled by Android.

English and Hindi are the translations actually included. To add a supported language, provide a complete `res/values-xx/strings.xml`, register its `AppLanguage`/Settings labels and `res/xml/locales_config.xml` entry, and extend the translation contract tests. Do not expose untranslated language options.

## Listen Together
1. The host starts a song, opens **Listen Together** from the full-player menu, and taps **Create room**.
2. Use **Copy code** or **Share** to send the ten-character code to everyone listening.
3. Each friend opens Listen Together, enters/pastes the same code, and taps **Join room**, then **Sync & play**.
4. Turn on **Follow host** to follow later song/playback changes. The host uses **Open player** to control the music. Multiple friends can use the same room code.

Going back does not leave the room; **Leave room** stops sharing/following without stopping ordinary local playback. Keep Dkord running: room sessions are app-process-lifetime, not persistent accounts or a guaranteed always-on room service. Reconnection resumes from the last received cursor, with backoff for network errors/rate limiting. Independent buffering/network/device clocks mean synchronization is approximate, not sample-accurate.

### Room transport and privacy (developer details)
The current transport is HTTPS to the **public ntfy.sh relay**, with a twelve-hour cache query. Room payloads contain video ID/title/artist/thumbnail, playback position/state/timestamp and at most ten upcoming tracks. They never contain audio streams, YouTube cookies or account credentials. Each phone resolves its own audio.

Room messages are **not end-to-end encrypted**, and anyone who knows the code can read or publish to its topic. There is no authenticated host identity or participant-presence/count protocol; the app does not invent these. Do not share a code publicly. Public-relay availability and free-service rate limits can affect room delivery. Live two-device/device compatibility has not been verified by the source/static checks below.

## New Releases
The Home section stays collapsed until opened. Categories: All / Hollywood / Bollywood / **Choliwood** / Punjabi / Tamil / Telugu. Windows: last 24 hours / 7 days / 10 days. Discovery expands music albums and uses music-song searches; publication/upload metadata determines recency, **not a guarantee of the original commercial release date**. Unknown dates are not guessed; date/network failures have retryable states instead of pretending the catalogue is empty. Tapping a song retains the full shelf as the queue and existing related autoplay.

## Build and regression checks
Stack: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose (Material 3), AppCompat application locales, NewPipeExtractor, Media3, Room, DataStore, WorkManager, Coil and Koin. Exact versions are in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Android builds require JDK 21 and SDK platform 37.

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s .github/scripts -p 'test_*.py' -v
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug --stacktrace
```

Both GitHub Actions workflows are **manual-only**; a push does not build or publish:
- **Build debug APK** runs the Python regressions, full Android unit suite and debug build, then uploads `dkord-debug-apk`. Without the existing signing secrets, a developer debug APK cannot update an official install.
- **Release APK** takes a tag matching `versionName` (next prepared tag: `v0.8.0`, versionCode `9`; `v0.7.0` is already published), runs the Python and full Android unit suites/build, requires the existing stable key (`DKORD_KEYSTORE_B64`, `DKORD_KEYSTORE_PASS`, alias `dkord`), and checks the actual old/new APK signatures, package and increasing versionCode. Only then does it create the tag/release page and attach the APK. No previous release is overwritten or removed. Start a **fresh run on the prepared branch**, not a re-run of old jobs.
- Both workflows preserve Android unit-test reports as an artifact, including failed runs where reports exist. Resource/source/workflow checks are not a substitute for Android compilation, UI/device tests or a real multi-phone room session. Current validation/execution status is recorded in `HANDOFF.md`; pending tests are not claimed as passing.

## How playback works (and why it can break)
Streams are resolved on the phone through a chain: NewPipeExtractor, then the YouTube InnerTube ANDROID_VR and IOS clients, then both again with fresh visitor data. Only audio-only streams (m4a/opus) are used. URLs are cached until they expire and re-resolved automatically on HTTP 403.

YouTube changes often, so extraction can break. **Settings → Troubleshooting → Update extractor** checks the bundled extractor's upstream version; updating the extractor requires an app update. **Report broken playback** copies a redacted log and opens a GitHub issue; **Debug log** shows recent events. Bot checks, age/kids restrictions, private/region-locked/unavailable tracks and network errors have explicit messages. Guest mode does not bypass account/age restrictions.

## Downloads
A single song downloads as tagged M4A from its three-dot menu → Download. A playlist/album's top-bar export saves a **JSON file** (name + tracks), not all of its audio; import it again from Library. Normal music downloads use WorkManager and support pause/resume across app restarts independently of the in-app APK updater.

## Video (optional)
Audio stays the default. **Play video** opens a separate player and pauses background audio; downloads are unaffected. It selects a muxed progressive stream up to 720p, with subtitles when available, fullscreen/landscape and retry. YouTube often offers muxed streams only up to about 360p. Blocked/unavailable videos show an error rather than an invented stream. Device validation remains required.

## Signing in: unavailable
Cookie-copy WebView sign-in is removed. Signed-in YouTube Music library/personalization relies on private cookie-authenticated APIs; official Google OAuth does not provide that library access. The app states that sign-in is unavailable rather than faking it, and old stored sessions are cleared. Anonymous search, radio, playback, downloads, local playlists and lyrics remain available. No cookie-paste workflow or TLS/certificate bypass is included.

## Network/privacy
No analytics and no Dkord account server. The app contacts YouTube/Google for music/media, LRCLIB for lyrics, and GitHub for foreground app-update checks and explicit extractor-version checks. Only creating/joining a room starts ntfy room traffic; leaving cancels its jobs. TLS validation stays enabled. The room privacy limitations above apply even though their technical explanation is no longer displayed as a large paragraph on the main room screen.
